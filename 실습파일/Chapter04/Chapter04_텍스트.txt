    Miracles happen to only those who believe in them.
    Think like a man of action and act like man of thought.
    Courage is very important. Like a muscle, it is strengthened by use.
    Life is the art of drawing sufficient conclusions from insufficient premises.
    By doubting we come at the truth.
    A man that has no virtue in himself, ever envies virtue in others.
    When money speaks, the truth keeps silent.
    Better the last smile than the first laughter.
